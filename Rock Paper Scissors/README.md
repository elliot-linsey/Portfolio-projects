This is a version of the classic game Rock, Paper, Scissors. The game asks for your input, which can be either 'r', 'p' or 's' (or 'exit' to halt the game). When you have made your choice, the computer chooses one option randomly, if your option beats the computer then you gain a point and vice versa. If you both choose the same option then you draw and no points are added. It is the first to 5 points to win. This is mainly an exercise in control flow as well as defining function attributes that can be used for purposes such as keeping score or resetting the list that you can choose from, as well as testing a kill switch to exit the program.
