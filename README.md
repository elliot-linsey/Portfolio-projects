# Portfolio-projects

Hi there!

This is my repository of portfolio projects. Within this space I am trying to upload projects and pieces of work showcasing specific skills
that I have learned during my studies and through independent research. 

As of now, this is all being done in Python 3 with a primary focus on data science and analysis, including the use of modules such as pandas, numpy
scipy, seaborn and matplotlib. 

I hope you find some of these projects interesting and please get in contact if you have any suggestions or feedback! 

Thanks 

Elliot
