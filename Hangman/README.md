This is a simple game of hangman. It selects a word randomly from a list, then asks the user for an input. If the input is correct, the empty list is updated to include the correct letter.
When the word is completed, you win. 
If the input is not correct, the input is added to a list of previous choices (so you can avoid making them again), a counter also decreases. When the counter hits 0, the game ends.
