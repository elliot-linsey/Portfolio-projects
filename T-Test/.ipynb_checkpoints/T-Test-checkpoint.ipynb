    "A T-Test is used to decide whether the differences between two sample sets of data are significantly different. The test can either be one or two-tailed and this is related to the question being asked. If you have 2 sets of grades from students and you ask \"Is class one significantly (higher or lower) to class 2\", then the test is one-tailed. If you ask \"Are the results between class one and two significantly different?\", then it would be two-tailed as it is open-ended, either class could be higher or lower. It also matters if the data is paired or unpaired, an example of paired would be the same persons height being measured at different ages, these values are related and connected due to being the same person at different times in their lives. Unpaired could be a comparison between two classes of students, as neither student is in both classes it does not matter the order of the data and whether they are grouped together or not, thus they are unpaired"

    "The tests that I have imported above are of either unpaired or paired (stats.ttest_ind and stats.ttest_rel), but they are both two-tailed so they work for open-ended questions. ttest_ind is independent, so unpaired and ttest_rel is related so paired. A t-test will result in a p-value (probability value) to determine whether the differences are significant. Within science, a p-value of less than 0.05 shows that the results have a more than 95% chance of being significant, this confidence interval is the most common however some may ask for a value of less than 0.01 for extreme certainty. For a t-test to work, both sample populations must have at least 10 samples, however they do not have to be the same size, this is a useful test for small sampling populations but the accuracy will improve with more samples."

This method is an attempt to stop us relying on location estimates such as means to generalize an answer between two sets of data and instead have an empirically backed number to tell us whether the differences are legitimate or due to random chance.
